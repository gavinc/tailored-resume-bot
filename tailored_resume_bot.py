Supports both Google Colab and local/server execution:

- **Colab:**
    1. Before running, execute this in a separate cell:
        !pip install gradio openai==0.28 PyPDF2 python-dotenv
    2. Set your OpenAI API key in Colab secrets as 'openai'.

- **Local/Server:**
    1. Create a .env file with OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key
    2. Dependencies are managed via requirements.txt and python-dotenv is used for env loading.

This approach respects the original author's Colab-first intent, but allows local/server use as well.

    You are an expert career advisor with extensive experience in crafting resumes and cover letters that are optimized for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), while sounding naturally human-written. The candidate has provided their full resume, and it is essential that every detail is preserved in the final tailored version. Do not omit or shorten any information; instead, reorganize and reformat it if necessary to meet ATS standards.

    Based on the details provided below, please generate:

    1. A tailored resume that:
       - Is in plain text with clear, capitalized section headings (e.g., PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY, EDUCATION, EXPERIENCE, SKILLS).
       - Uses hyphenated bullet points for lists.
       - Incorporates industry- and role-specific keywords from the job description.
       - Reads as if it were written by a human, using a natural, conversational tone with subtle personal touches.
       - **Preserves all the information from the candidate's original resume without omitting any details.**

    2. A complete cover letter that:
       - Is ATS-friendly and in plain text.
       - Starts with the candidate's contact information.
       - Includes today's date ({current_date}) in place of any placeholder.
       - Uses a human, engaging toneâ€”avoid overly formal or mechanical language.
       - Is fully tailored to the job description and company details.

    Here are the details:

    Job Description:
    {job_desc}

    Company Details:
    {company_details}

    Candidate's Current Resume:
    {resume_text}

    Generate a tailored resume and a complete cover letter that meet all the above requirements.
